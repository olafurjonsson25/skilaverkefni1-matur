            <p>We want all communication in the workplace to be responsible and professional. Joy isn't forbidden, but
                backtalk is.

                We want all employees at The Happy Llama to be role models for new employees.
                We want The Happy Llama's customers to experience interacting with The Happy Llama's staff as
                professional, cheerful and
                solution-oriented.

                We ensure that everyone has equal rights to professional development and wages, we never discriminate
                based on gender, sex, religion or nationality.
                We want the door to flexibility to open in both directions. We can't demand flexibility if we can't
                provide it in return.
